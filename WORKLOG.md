# Mobile Worklog

## 2026-08-22 — Slice 1: application foundation and Discovery Trending

- Initial repo audit: clean tree, only initial commit and README; no pre-existing app, checklist, tests, or user changes.
- Read-only source inspected: backend `AGENTS.md`, navigation IA, `SolToken` contract, and `/api/trending` route.
- Added Expo Router five-tab shell and full More destination catalog.
- Added real configurable backend client, runtime validation, request cancellation, bounded retries/cache behavior, and explicit loading/error/empty/stale/provenance states.
- Added responsive dense market list with search, timeframe and sorting controls, pull-to-refresh, and validated snapshot token detail.
- Added security-by-default repository/config rules and an explicit transaction safety gate notice; no mock runtime data or financial writes.
- Added Jest contract/format tests and durable requirements tracking.
- Verification evidence: `npm run typecheck` passed; `npm run lint` passed; Jest 2 suites / 3 tests passed; Expo Doctor 21/21 checks passed; Expo web static export produced all 14 expected routes.
- Dependency note: `npm audit --omit=dev` reports 10 moderate advisories in Expo CLI's `xcode -> uuid` build-tool chain. npm's only proposed remediation downgrades Expo to 46, so no forced/breaking fix was applied; the code path is tooling rather than app runtime.
- Next priority: complete Discover subviews, durable watchlist/filter state, search API, pagination and token detail contract fetches.

## 2026-08-22 — Slice 2: complete Discovery catalog and live token detail

- Re-audited clean mobile history, checklist, worklog, tests, and read-only backend routes for Search, Trending variants, New Pairs pagination, and token detail evidence.
- Connected Losers, New Pairs, Hot Searches, Surge, NextBC, Pump Live, and Watchlist modes to their real backend endpoints; no runtime fixtures were introduced.
- Added cursor-aware infinite loading, server-backed debounced search, DEX/liquidity/market-cap filters, pull-to-refresh, deduplication, and truthful source/status display.
- Added durable AsyncStorage persistence for non-secret watchlists and filters with bounded values, idempotent star controls, and reset behavior.
- Replaced snapshot-only detail with `/api/token/[address]` refresh, validated evidence fields, stale-snapshot fallback, retry behavior, and explicit automation readiness labels.
- Verification evidence: `npm run typecheck` and `npm run lint` passed; Jest 4 suites / 8 tests passed including backend routing, URL hardening, response validation, formatting, and accessible row/watchlist behavior; Expo Doctor passed 21/21; Expo exported all 14 web routes.
- Next priority: token chart/transactions/holders/security/narrative/pairs vertical slice.

## 2026-08-22 — Slice 3: token intelligence evidence tabs

- Inspected read-only backend contracts for OHLCV, holders, transactions, risk, narrative, smart money, and liquidity pairs.
- Added runtime schemas and typed clients for all seven contracts; malformed financial values fail closed into explicit errors.
- Added a real SVG price chart with backend source/quality labels and timeframe switching.
- Added token tabs for sampled holder distribution, observed partial trades/finality, safety score factors, narrative evidence, smart-money signals, and pair liquidity/freshness.
- Kept critical limitations adjacent to data: holder sampling, incomplete transaction history, non-guaranteed scoring, probabilistic labels, and reported TVL versus executable depth.
- Verification evidence: TypeScript and Expo lint passed cleanly; Jest 5 suites / 12 tests passed; Expo Doctor passed 21/21; Expo web export produced all 14 routes with the SVG chart bundle.
- Next priority: secure wallet/session foundation and read-only portfolio identity flow before any transaction construction.

## 2026-08-22 — Slice 4: secure wallet identity and Portfolio

- Re-audited the clean mobile repo and inspected backend CopyTrade challenge/verification, ownership, wallet, PnL, Portfolio, and analytics contracts.
- Integrated the current official Solana Mobile Wallet Adapter kit for Android custom development builds; no private key, mnemonic, seed phrase, or signing material enters app storage.
- Implemented backend ownership challenge signing with credentialed HTTP-only cookie handling and exact wallet confirmation.
- Stored wallet authorization and verified-session metadata in Expo SecureStore, aligned expiry to the backend's 24-hour cookie, re-locked after one minute backgrounded, and required biometric/device authentication to unlock.
- Disconnect clears local verification, secure MWA authorization, native app cookies, and wallet authorization. iOS/web explicitly offer watch-only mode because current native MWA support is Android-only.
- Built Portfolio with verified/watch-only identity labels, provider-backed holdings/allocation/risk, real PnL evidence, explicit unavailable cost basis/unrealized metrics, periods, refresh, and error states.
- Added custom-development and production EAS profiles, deep-link scheme configuration, secure-store/local-auth/cookie plugins, and Expo dev-client workflow.
- Verification evidence: strict TypeScript and lint passed; Jest 6 suites / 18 tests passed including expiry, biometric, secure-storage payload, portfolio provenance, and client routing; Expo Doctor passed 21/21; production bundles exported successfully for web (14 routes), Android, and iOS.
- Known upstream warning: Metro falls back to file resolution for an unexported Noble hashes crypto subpath used transitively by the current Solana wallet stack; all three bundles complete successfully.
- Next priority: Trenches launch/migration boards and safe trade handoff into a non-executing quote review.

## 2026-08-22 — Slice 5: Trenches and safe quote review

- Re-audited the clean mobile tree and inspected backend Trenches, Jupiter quote/build, submission, quote-integrity, readiness, and freshness contracts.
- Replaced the Trenches placeholder with real New, Almost Bonded, and Migrated lanes, 30-second refresh, bonding progress, dense launch metrics, provider quality, detail navigation, and explicit quote-review actions.
- Added a dedicated non-executing trade review route with buy/sell modes, USD/SOL/token units, bounded amount syntax, and a safer client slippage ceiling of 5%.
- Validated exact raw/UI amounts, real-route identity, minimum received, context slot, price impact, backend route plan, and the exact 15-second quote build window.
- The screen never calls `/api/swap/build` or `/api/swap/submit`; execution remains disabled until decoded simulation, explicit final confirmation, block-height checks, idempotency/replay protection, and guarded signing are implemented.
- Verification evidence: strict TypeScript and lint passed; Jest 7 suites / 22 tests passed without interaction warnings; Expo Doctor passed 21/21; web production export passed with all 15 routes including `/trade/[address]`; Android and iOS production bundles also passed.
- Next priority: Monitor/Track alerts, runtime evidence, and delivery status.

## 2026-08-22 — Slice 6: Monitor alerts and delivery truth

- Re-audited the clean mobile history and inspected the read-only backend monitor feed, owner-scoped alert CRUD, evaluator, delivery ledger, resource ownership, and tracker surfaces.
- Replaced the Monitor placeholder with a 30-second provider-evidenced Solana observation feed and direct token-detail handoff; empty and failed feeds never become synthetic activity.
- Added verified-wallet-only alert management for price, one-hour percentage change, and volume-spike rules with bounded positive inputs, in-app delivery, a 60-minute cooldown, pause/resume, and deletion.
- Added durable per-channel delivery diagnostics that distinguish queued, processing, delivered, failed, and unavailable outcomes with explicit reasons; a configured rule is never represented as delivered.
- Kept evaluator authority server-side: the mobile client never calls `/api/alerts/evaluate` and does not claim operating-system background monitoring. The Track destination remains queued because the backend explicitly has no connected live tracker provider and suppresses its historical screenshot fixtures.
- Verification evidence: strict TypeScript and lint passed; Jest 8 suites / 26 tests passed including alert schema, credentialed routing, evaluator isolation, delivery timestamp requirements, and financial-input gating; Expo Doctor passed 21/21; web production export passed all 15 routes; Android and iOS production bundles passed.
- Known upstream warning remains unchanged: Metro falls back to file resolution for the current Solana wallet stack's unexported Noble hashes crypto subpath; all production bundles complete successfully.
- Next priority: complete CopyTrade rankings/config/review truth without enabling unsafe automatic execution.

## 2026-08-22 — Slice 7: guarded CopyTrade strategy review

- Re-audited the clean mobile state and inspected the read-only backend Top Traders ranking, wallet-ranking evidence, CopyTrade readiness, owner-scoped durable configs, positions, executions, validation, and live execution endpoints.
- Activated CopyTrade and Top Traders from More with a dedicated dense Rank/Strategies/Activity route backed by real provider or indexed realized-PnL evidence and explicit source/quality limitations.
- Added verified-wallet, durable-storage-gated strategy review with bounded fixed size, position/daily risk caps, slippage capped at 5%, price impact capped at 5%, liquidity/age filters, stop/take-profit policy, and a maximum of two positions.
- Enforced a fail-closed mobile invariant: new strategies must be persisted paused, active responses are rejected, and existing active strategies can only be paused or deleted. Mobile exposes no activate/toggle, copy, confirm, close, sign, or submit call.
- Added read-only durable positions and execution audit with paper/live mode, idempotency, status, amounts, errors, and explicit readiness; ranking evidence is never represented as expected future performance.
- Verification evidence: strict TypeScript and lint passed; Jest 9 suites / 32 tests passed including provenance, readiness, risk bounds, paused-state enforcement, forbidden endpoint isolation, and accessible review gating; Expo Doctor passed 21/21; web export passed all 16 routes including `/copytrade`; Android and iOS production bundles passed.
- Known upstream Noble hashes Metro fallback warning remains unchanged and non-fatal across all bundles.
- Next priority: AI Intelligence and paper-trading/governance surfaces, keeping every recommendation advisory-only.

## 2026-08-22 — Slice 8: advisory AI and paper governance

- Re-audited the clean mobile state and inspected the read-only backend recommendation evidence, public paper report, wallet-owned 31-phase platform governance, readiness, kill-switch, and approval/tool/mutation boundaries.
- Activated AI Intelligence from More with Advisories, Paper, and Governance views using real persisted data; no generated or fixture recommendations are used.
- Added fail-closed recommendation validation for point-in-time evidence, feature completeness, expiry, provider-family diversity, cost inclusion, advisory eligibility, model version, historical outcomes, and explicit `executionEnabled: false`.
- Added public read-only simulation reporting for equity/PnL/costs/drawdown, open and closed paper positions, adaptive research candidates, mark availability, operational status, readiness checks, and the mandatory kill switch.
- Added verified-wallet governance evidence for phases 8–31, evidence counts, blockers, operating history, and closed-trade progress. Both the platform envelope and Phase 31 must independently declare execution disabled.
- Mobile performs GET requests only for AI. It exposes no paper configuration/run/train/promote/reconcile, approval, tool, chat, model, wallet-signing, transaction-construction, or submission action.
- Verification evidence: strict TypeScript and lint passed; Jest 10 suites / 38 tests passed including execution-disabled contract rejection, simulation/kill-switch/read-only enforcement, GET-only routing, advisory qualification, and absence of execution affordances; Expo Doctor passed 21/21; web export passed all 17 routes including `/ai`; Android and iOS production bundles passed.
- Known upstream Noble hashes Metro fallback warning remains unchanged and non-fatal across all bundles.
- Next priority: remaining More destinations, settings, accessibility, localization, and deep-link/network/privacy hardening.

## 2026-08-22 — Slice 9: privacy, deep-link, and transport hardening

- Re-audited the clean mobile state, routes, storage keys, API-origin handling, app transport configuration, checklist, worklog, and existing tests.
- Added a durable Settings destination with English/Vietnamese navigation labels, reduced-motion preference, explicit default-off diagnostic consent, accessibility roles/states, security evidence, and a confirmed device-local privacy reset.
- Privacy reset disconnects and revokes the verified wallet session, clears secure authorization/cookies through the existing wallet boundary, removes all known watchlist/filter/watch-only/preference keys, and clears the in-memory query cache without claiming to delete server-owned records.
- Hardened API origins to HTTPS in production with loopback HTTP allowed only for development, removed path/query/fragment/credential smuggling, kept iOS ATS arbitrary loads disabled, and added an introspected Android manifest policy denying cleartext traffic and app-data backup.
- Hardened token/trade deep links with exact 32-byte base58 validation, UTF-8 byte-bounded snapshots, strict route/snapshot address equality, and zero backend requests for invalid addresses. Added bounded credential/signature/address redaction for any future opted-in diagnostics; no telemetry transport is configured.
- Verification evidence: strict TypeScript and Expo lint passed; Jest 11 suites / 43 tests passed; Expo Doctor passed 21/21; Expo config introspection confirmed `NSAllowsArbitraryLoads=false`, `android:usesCleartextTraffic=false`, and `android:allowBackup=false`; web export passed all 18 routes including `/settings`; Android and iOS production bundles passed.
- Known upstream Noble hashes Metro fallback warning remains unchanged and non-fatal across all bundles. Generated export directories were removed after verification.
- Next priority: implement the highest-value remaining More destination whose read-only backend contract can be proven without enabling unsafe execution, then expand full-screen localization and device accessibility evidence.

## 2026-08-22 — Slice 10: signature-backed Market Intelligence

- Re-audited the clean mobile state and read-only backend instructions/contracts for Signals, Heatmap, Claim Monitor, persisted event pagination, market trust exclusion, RPC health, and claim journaling.
- Activated Signals, Heatmap, and Claim Monitor from More through one dense Market Intelligence route; each More entry opens its intended tab and retains the approved catalog labels.
- Signals supports 24-hour/7-day windows, bounded server type filters, opaque cursor pagination, ingestion/provider/freshness evidence, deduplication, signature/source display, and exact 32-byte mint detail handoff. No CSV download, external link, evaluator, or transaction action is exposed.
- Heatmap uses only backend-filtered trustworthy Solana rows, orders tiles by reported 24-hour volume, colors by reported change, displays liquidity/trust flags and inclusion/exclusion counts, and hands off only validated mint addresses.
- Claim Monitor displays RPC health, scanned/detected/first/unpaid counts, transaction signatures, parsed SOL amounts, and confirmed/detected/fake state without opening backend-supplied URLs. It cannot claim, sign, move funds, or deliver messages.
- Added fail-closed runtime schemas and a degraded-evidence reader: structurally valid 503 payloads remain visible as unavailable/degraded evidence, while incompatible payloads still fail closed. All mobile Market Intelligence calls are GET-only.
- Verification evidence: strict TypeScript and warning-free Expo lint passed; Jest 12 suites / 49 tests passed; Expo Doctor passed 21/21; web production export passed all 19 routes including `/market-intelligence`; Android and iOS production bundles passed.
- Known upstream Noble hashes Metro fallback warning remains unchanged and non-fatal across all bundles. Generated exports were removed after verification.
- Next priority: Smart Money and Wallet Tracker using provider/indexed wallet evidence, while preserving verified ownership and no automatic execution boundaries.
